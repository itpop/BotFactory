The purpose of the assignments, collectively, is to let you apply the techniques from the lessons and tutorials. As previously decribed, you are building a small but complete webapp, to manage a simple robot factory. Refer to assignment one for business logic descriptions.

The purpose of this assignment (#2) is to add functionality to the mockup pieces from assignment #1, using a real (not mock) database and connecting to the Panda Research Center (PRC) for live data.
